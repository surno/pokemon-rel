# Pokemon Shiny Bot - Refactored Version 🎮

## What Was Done

The original `main.py` was **1,130 lines** of hard-to-read code all jumbled together. I've refactored it into **8 clean, focused modules** that are much easier to understand, test, and maintain.

## Before vs After

### Before (1 huge file):
```
main.py (1,130 lines)
├── All imports mixed together
├── Global variables everywhere  
├── Network code mixed with AI code
├── Image processing mixed with rewards
├── Training logic mixed with game logic
└── Very hard to find anything!
```

### After (8 focused modules):
```
src/
├── config.py                  # 📋 All settings in one place
├── network.py                 # 🌐 TCP communication 
├── image_processing.py        # 🖼️  Image conversion & display
├── device_utils.py            # 💻 GPU/CPU detection
├── reward_system.py           # 🎯 Pokemon gameplay rewards
├── loop_detection.py          # 🔄 Prevents getting stuck
├── pokemon_environment.py     # 🎮 Main game environment
├── trainer.py                 # 🤖 AI training logic
└── main_refactored.py         # 🚀 Clean entry point (80 lines!)
```

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. **Much Easier to Read** 📖
- Each file has one clear purpose
- Functions are well-documented
- No more hunting through 1,000+ lines

### 2. **Easier to Test** 🧪
- Can test each module independently
- Mock individual components
- Find bugs faster

### 3. **Easier to Modify** 🔧
- Want to change rewards? Edit `reward_system.py`
- Network issues? Check `network.py`
- Display problems? Look at `image_processing.py`

### 4. **Easier to Understand** 💡
- Clear separation of concerns
- Each module does one thing well
- New developers can understand it quickly

## How to Use

### Simple Usage (same as before):
```bash
cd src
python main_refactored.py
```

### Advanced Usage:
```bash
# Test mode only (no AI training)
python main_refactored.py --mode test

# Custom training
python main_refactored.py --mode train --timesteps 50000

# Load and test a saved model
python main_refactored.py --mode load --model-path my_model
```

## Module Breakdown

### 🔧 config.py
- All constants and settings
- Network ports, image dimensions, training parameters
- Easy to tweak without hunting through code

### 🌐 network.py  
- TCP socket communication with Lua script
- Connection management and error recovery
- Graceful shutdown handling

### 🖼️ image_processing.py
- Converts game screen data to usable formats
- Handles display and debugging
- Image manipulation utilities

### 💻 device_utils.py
- Detects GPU/CPU capabilities
- Optimizes training parameters for your hardware
- Supports CUDA, Apple Silicon, and CPU

### 🎯 reward_system.py
- Pokemon-specific reward calculations
- Encourages good gameplay behaviors
- Menu detection, movement tracking, exploration rewards

### 🔄 loop_detection.py
- Prevents AI from getting stuck in loops
- Detects visual, action, and movement patterns
- Applies penalties to encourage variety

### 🎮 pokemon_environment.py
- Main OpenAI Gym environment
- Ties all components together
- Handles game state and actions

### 🤖 trainer.py
- AI training with PPO algorithm
- Test mode for monitoring
- Model saving/loading

### 🚀 main_refactored.py
- Clean entry point (only 80 lines!)
- Command-line interface
- Easy to understand flow

## Key Improvements

1. **Maintainability**: Code is organized and documented
2. **Testability**: Each module can be tested independently  
3. **Readability**: Clear structure and purpose for each file
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features without breaking existing code
5. **Debugging**: Much easier to find and fix issues

## Migration Guide

If you were using the old `main.py`:

1. Replace `python main.py` with `python src/main_refactored.py`
2. All functionality remains the same
3. Configuration is now in `src/config.py` instead of scattered throughout the file
4. Each component can now be imported and used independently

## Future Development

This modular structure makes it much easier to:
- Add new reward types (edit `reward_system.py`)
- Improve network stability (edit `network.py`) 
- Add new AI algorithms (edit `trainer.py`)
- Support new image formats (edit `image_processing.py`)
- Add new detection methods (edit `loop_detection.py`)

The refactored code is **professional-grade** and ready for long-term development! 🚀
